== How It Works ==

The ZipTax sales tax plugin uses your product and store settings to determine sales tax rates in real time as your customers enter their information. We factor the customer's zip code, city, state, and county to ensure proper sales tax collection for all US jurisdictions. The calculated rate is automatically applied to the sale during checkout.
